#Prompt: Flutter App with MVVM + REST API (Crypto Info)

Create a Flutter app that fetches cryptocurrency market data and derivatives exchange data from the CoinGecko REST API, using MVVM architecture.

## Requirements:
Use MVVM pattern to separate logic.
Create a reusable NetworkService to perform generic API requests.
Define API base URL https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/ and two endpoints:
coins/markets (with vs_currency=usd and optional params)
derivatives/exchanges

Show results in a ListView with a segmented Picker toggle for:
Coin Markets
Derivatives Exchanges

Each list item should include:
Coin image and price (for market coins)
Exchange name, country, and year (for exchanges)
On API failure, display an Alert with the title: "Request is Failured"
Set the Navigation title to "Crypto Info"

## ðŸ”§ Libraries to Use
http (for REST API calls)
provider (for MVVM state management)
cached_network_image (for loading images)
cupertino_icons (for CupertinoPicker)
